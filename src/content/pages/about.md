# Hi, I'm Justin

I am a software engineer focused on backend systems, internal platforms, and developer workflows. I build practical solutions that reduce operational friction and help teams execute with confidence.

## Core Strengths

- Designing reliable backend services and integrations.
- Building internal tools that simplify complex engineering workflows.
- Translating technical constraints into clear, business-aligned decisions.

## Impact Highlights

- Delivered tooling and process improvements that made day-to-day engineering work simpler and more reliable.
- Improved system reliability through maintainable architecture and stronger observability practices.
- Helped teams move faster with reusable patterns, clearer documentation, and practical implementation playbooks.

## Working Style

I value ownership, clear communication, and thoughtful execution. I enjoy collaborating across engineering and partner teams, aligning on outcomes early, and delivering incrementally with quality in focus.

If you are looking for a builder who can connect technical detail to practical impact, I would be glad to connect.
