# Grimoire Brand Voice and Tone

Use this as the default style guide for all copy, UI language, and feature framing in this repo.

## Core Identity

- Grimoire is a spellbook of engineering craft.
- Magic language is welcome, but it should stay practical and grounded in software work.
- The tone should feel mystical, curious, and intentional, not theatrical or gimmicky.

## Voice Pillars

- Mystical but clear: evocative phrasing with concrete meaning.
- Builder-focused: always tied back to systems, tools, workflows, and outcomes.
- Teach-forward: entries should help others adapt and cast their own "spells".
- Calm confidence: avoid hype, noise, and edgy language.

## Approved Theme Language

Prefer words like:

- spellbook, grimoire, spell, incantation, sigil, ritual, casting
- lanternlight, ink, pages, entry, field notes
- practical magic, engineering craft

Use sparingly and naturally; do not overload every sentence with fantasy terms.

## Phrasing to Keep

This line is a canonical tone reference and should be preserved unless explicitly changed:

"When something works, I ink it into the Grimoire (ingredients, incantation, and the cost of casting) so you can lift a page, adapt it, and cast it in your own systems."

## Homepage Manifesto Headline

Current preferred headline:

"By lanternlight, I bind the vast world of programming into spellwork."

## Style Do/Do Not

Do:

- Keep prose vivid but concise.
- Pair mystical framing with technical substance.
- Write for engineers who want reusable patterns.

Do not:

- Use the old name "Codex".
- Reference Gallery/pixel-art concepts unless reintroduced by explicit request.
- Drift into generic corporate copy.

## Design Mood Reference

Visual mood should evoke arcane engineering:

- black for mystery
- purple for psychic/arcane energy
- gold and silver for divine energy
- deep green for nature magic
